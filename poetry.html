            <p><strong>When the Moon says</strong><br>O child o child,<br>In this night and all that has come,<br>I shine the most and make all the stars like tiny dots;<br>The sky at night is all mine, without me it is dark and void.<br>I bring up the tides making all the oceans alive,<br>What do you know O child about my might? <br>The men look up at me, they pray me and fear me.<br>But you O child, you are of a different kind, <br>When I look at you every night sitting under my light <br>Goes away all my pride... <br>Cause however mighty i might be, <br>I shine the brightest only once in a while And fade away until I am none. <br>But you O child you toil and struggle, <br>You serve and care, you pick up the frail, <br>You hold down the pain; <br>And repeat these tasks day after day. <br>Yet here you are, like everyday sitting in your chair <br>And looking up at me and wondering, <br>If I am bored looking at you, <br>No my sweet child ... <br>You are an angel that shines brighter than me.

            <p><strong>My Dear inquired of me, “What is peace?”!</strong><br> You are standing in the meadows<br> In between the long green grass<br> Waiting for someone<br> Wearing a long white gown<br> You shine as bright as diamonds.<br> I come riding by the lake<br> Riding a horse as white as snow<br> I come gracefully towards you<br> But there is also a bit of haste in my movements<br> Cause I am eager to meet you.<br> I come and halt besides you<br> Mesmerized by your beauty<br> You smile back at me<br> And that my love..<br> is what I want in this whole wide world.<br> You offer me your hand<br> I bend and put my fingers in yours<br> Grab you by the waist<br> And pull you to my steed<br> Placing your tender body in front of me.<br> I seize the reigns, imprisoning you between my arms<br> Feeling your soft hair in my face<br> I put my chin on your shoulder<br> I pull the reigns<br> We move forward towards the woods<br> And I whisper in your ears-<br> “And this my love is what I call peace”.<br>
